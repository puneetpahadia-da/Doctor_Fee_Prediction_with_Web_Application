## Overview 📋

The **Doctor's Fee Prediction** project focuses on predicting consultation fees for doctors based on attributes such as specialty, experience, location, and more. The project involves data extraction, preprocessing, model building, and an interactive web application.

## Project Details 🚧

This project utilizes Python libraries such as NumPy and Pandas for data cleaning and preprocessing purposes. Matplotlib and Seaborn are used for data analysis and visualization. Scikit-learn (sklearn) is employed for building the machine learning model. Flask, HTML, and CSS are used to build an interactive website.

The main objective is to predict doctor consultation fees based on the following attributes:

- `speciality_of_doctor`: Specialty of the doctor
- `degree_type`: Type of degree (e.g., MBBS, MD, BDS)
- `year_of_experience`: Total years of experience
- `Location`: Clinic location
- `city`: City of the clinic
- `dp_score`: Doctor-patient experience score
- `npv_`: Number of people's votes

## Python Files 🐍

### Data Extraction 🌐
- The data extraction phase involves collecting raw doctor information from the online medical consultancy booking site Practo. This is achieved using the Jupyter Notebook `Scrapping code.ipynb`.

### Data Preprocessing 🧹
- In the preprocessing phase, data is cleaned, missing values are handled, and exploratory data analysis is performed. The Jupyter Notebook `Preprocessing_EDA.ipynb` includes the cleaning and visualization code.

### Machine Learning Modeling 🤖
- The machine learning model is built using Scikit-learn and is implemented in the Jupyter Notebook `ML_Models.ipynb`. This model predicts the consultation fee for doctors based on the provided attributes.

## DATA 📊

### Raw Data 📂
- The collected data is stored in `raw_practo.csv`.

### Cleaned Data 🧼
- The cleaned data is saved in `clean_practo.csv`.

## Web Application 💻

The project includes an interactive web application developed with Flask. The application allows users to input values for `speciality_of_doctor`, `degree_type`, `year_of_experience`, `Location`, `city`, `dp_score`, and `npv_` to obtain a predicted consultation fee for doctors. The machine learning model, stored as `model.pkl`, is integrated into the web application.
